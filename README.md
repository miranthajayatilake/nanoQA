# Chat with your data to find answers :mag: :zap: 

nanoQA uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a question-answering application on your own data.

**Please refer to this blog post for a comprehensive guide** :heavy_exclamation_mark: [LINK](https://medium.com/@miranthaj/building-a-chat-ai-to-answer-about-your-own-data-part-i-f05dde32ff1b)

## Quick start

- Create a virtual environment with python (Tested with `python 3.10.9` on [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/))
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependecies.
- Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is up and running in your local environment. We use docker to set up [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html) as our data store.
- Run `bash datastore.sh` to pull and set up elasticsearch. Wait till this step is completed.
- Run `python sample_data.py data/faq_covid https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/deepset.ai-farm-qa/datasets/documents/small_faq_covid.csv.zip index_qa`. This script will download a sample dataset of FAQs on COVID 19 and index it under `index_qa`. This dataset and index name are for demo purposes. You can replace this with your own data and naming.
- Run `streamlit run app.py` to spin up the user interface.

Now you can provide your index name and start chatting with your data.
